Database of movies I have seen, and want to see - see spreadsheet
Database of series I have seen, partially seen and want to seen - see spreadsheet

Include loads of information including what I thought, my rating, my rating after research/re-watch
Include reason for watching, notable actors etc
Use an api or at worst a web scraper to grab the imdb data for the media, along with trailer link, thumbnail etc

Perhaps use python to modify the database? Security levels on the website?
