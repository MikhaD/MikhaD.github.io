# Soon to be Portfolio Website
This is what will soon become my portfolio website. I previously had some basic nonsense here written 3 years ago. This wasn't a problem until my [wordle](mikhad.github.io/wordle) game gained popularity, leading to increased traffic to the root domain by curious people. I have put this basic placeholder here in the meantime.
